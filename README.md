# Who am I?
 My name is Oat Asdon, and I am a developer with passion and enthusiasm for problem solving and coding that expresses my creativity! I bring to the table my customer-oriented sales experience from my past career into development which will be useful when pitching ideas to clients and investors alike. I believe perpetual learning is key to success


# Why did I join General Assembly's WDI?

I reached a point in my life where an unstable career eventually became a dead-end job. I was not about to sit and wait around for some miracle to support my wife and unborn child, so I took a chance: I quit my day job(my only source of income) and emptied my savings account to pay for tuition. My scariest life decision became the best choice I have ever made. Web Development Immersive has not only open opportunities for me, it unlocked a passion and a vast potential I did not know I had. Coding is now my passion and my way of life.
The most important skill I learned from General Assembly was not the ability to program, but the ability to be a perpetual learner. The hard work I put behind my code is fueled by passion that stems from curiosity of wanting more.
There is always something new to learn every single day of your life. General Assembly has taught me to embrace that, and turn it in to passion.

# A little about me

I have been interested in games since I was young. I had my first taste in programming when I was 12 years old in 1997, I tried my hand at 'modding' a game called Quake. 'Modding' is a term used for the practice of modifying the assets from a certain game to change game play, elements, story, or functionality in the game. Because I was always a tinkerer growing up, modding, and eventually coding, became a natural progression from gaming for me.
